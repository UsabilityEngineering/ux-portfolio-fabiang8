I use Trading View for when I need more in depth information about a certain stcok / asset. It handles most of my needs for the most part , but I do have my gripes with it.I believe that when using it from a web application view , it is okay. When opened in the "full" version it quickly becomes unwieldy and intimidating. I believe this quality of being intimidating is what kept me from adopting it for a while.
