I have been using BASH scripting language for about ~3 years now. Shell scripting fills a need for a language that can complete repetitive tasks. A good example would be a shell script that automates the compiling process for a certain project or a script which was customized for searching log files. A common feature for Shell scripting languages is the ability to carry out commands on a group of files and being able to perform file name substitution. Bash Scripting demonstrates the application of "Flexibility and efficiency of use", by providing a number of accelerators to complete tasks more efficiently.
