I use PokerStars from time to time for entertainment.I enjoy playing poker so it is cool to use this application. A common feature for Poker gaming sites is to be recognizable , so that it is easy to use. I believe PokerStars does this better then a lot of other different interfaces which it competes with.

In Poker sites it is common to represent the game by using a virtual table and representing the players using hole cards being displayed on the seats.The above picture shows the gaming interface for PokerStars, I believe it is learnable and easy to recognize. This interface demonstates an application of "Recognition rather than recall". Most of the options to manipulate the interface are readily available , and easy to recognize. When using a Poker gaming interface my main (**goals**) for the interaction would be.

(**Goals & Interaction**)
- That the interface is easy to recognize and use intuitively so it does not interfere with my game
- Somewhat good looking since I will be looking at it for hours on end
- I am provided infomation about the game consistently and accurately 

(**Narative**)
I open PokerStars up , and log in. The first thing I am greeted by is about 30/40 different table games to join. I am looking for the microstakes(low roller) and am kind of lost in the sauce, with all the different tables and options available to me (Picture 1A.). I filter the table options to micro stakes to find the tables I am looking for. I believe the myriad of options hinders my ability to get where I am going, and there could be a more organized way of doing things.The things that help me accomplish my goals are being prepared to use the interface, and knowing which filter I am looking for. Which is not very learnable at first.Once I am in the game , this kind of flips back. I really enjoy using the PokerStars interface for actually playing (**1B**), but not their match finding interface.

(**Expected Outcome**)

Seamless gaming experience, the interface should not frustrate me.

(**Strengths**)
- Easy to understand and use
- Shows individual player accounts
- Recognized and known (most popular, largest user base)

(**Weakness**)
- The design is starting to look dated, when compared to some competitition
- Does not display current hand being held, which is a common feature I felt like was a common feature.Such as saying ," you hold , two pair."
- Finding a game menu is very intimidating , too many options at once
