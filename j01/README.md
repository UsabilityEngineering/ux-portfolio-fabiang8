I use PokerStars from time to time for entertainment.I enjoy playing poker so it is cool to use this application. A common feature for Poker gaming sites is to be recognizable , so that it is easy to use. I believe PokerStars does this better then a lot of other different interfaces which it competes with.

In Poker sites it is common to represent the game by using a virtual table and representing the players using hole cards being displayed on the seats.The above picture shows the gaming interface for PokerStars, I believe it is intuitive and easy to recognize. This interface demonstates an application of "Recognition rather than recall". Most of the options to manipulate the interface are readily available , and easy to recognize. When using a Poker gaming interface my main (**goals**) for the interaction would be.\
\
(**Goals & Interaction**)
- That the interface is easy to recognize and use intuitively so it does not interfere with my game
- Somewhat good looking since I will be looking at it for hours on end
- I am provided infomation about the game consistently and accurately 
\

(**Expected Outcome**)

Seamless gaming experience, the interface should not frustrate me.

(**Strengths**)
- Easy to understand and use
- Shows individual player accounts
- Recognized and known (most popular, largest user base)

(**Weakness**)
- The design is starting to look dated, when compared to some competitition
- Does not display current hand being held, which is a common feature I felt like
