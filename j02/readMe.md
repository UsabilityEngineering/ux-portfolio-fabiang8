(**Interaction**)
I use Trading View for when I need more in depth information about a certain stock / asset. It handles most of my needs for the most part , but I do have my gripes with it.I believe that when using it from a web application view , it is okay. When opened in the "full" version it quickly becomes unwieldy and intimidating. I believe this quality of being intimidating is what kept me from adopting it for a while.

From the Web App view I believe that Trading View is somewhat effective. I believe the nature of these kinds of application will always be complicated due to all the different information they have to display. I believe that over time, I began to learn how to use Trading View and it became more intuitive. Although I would say that it took me longer to learn Trading View then other applications.

(**Goals**)
- Be able to retrieve the information I need effectively 
- watch real time data 
- maneuverability

(**Outcome**)
I can usually stumble my way around TradingView, but still find myself having to remember how to use its features. I am not as intimidated as I use to be , but still have to google how to use certain niche features. 

(**Strengths**)
- Accurate , fast information
- Cheap and effective
- A lot of powerful features

(**Weakness**)
- Steep learning curve for novice like me
- A bit intimidating at first and even with experience
- Does not follow (**"Aesthetic and minimalist design"**). It is very complicated and displays a lot of details that are rarely used
